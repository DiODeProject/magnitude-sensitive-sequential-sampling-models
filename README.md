# magnitude-sensitive-sequential-sampling-models
Supplementary material

This repository provides additional material accompanying the manuscript *Comparison of magnitude-sensitive sequential sampling models in a simulation-based study*, including data files and computer code for fitting and data analysis. The manuscript, including the Supplementary Material, is currently *under review*.

In the supplementary material all fitted model parameters are stored as `csv-files` in the folder `CSV_Files`, which is located in the parent folder `ModelFitting`. In the same folder we included the notebook `GetFittedParameters.ipynb` which can be used to interactively retrieve fitted parameters and values of the objective by choosing `data set number` and `data-generating model`. This is all explained in the notebook.

We also included all procedures (written in Python 3 code) we used to simulate data and to fit models. Script files to run batch jobs on a cluster are included as well (when recomputing results, those will need to be adjusted depending on the computational facilities available). 

We hope this repository is useful for everyone interested in our study. In case you would like more information please get in touch (t.bose@sheffield.ac.uk).
